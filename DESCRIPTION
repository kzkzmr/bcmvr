Description: 
    Provides treatment effect inference for longitudinal outcomes with skewed
    distributions using a Box-Cox multivariate regression (BCMVR) model.
    Models are fitted separately by group, and prespecified group comparisons
    are conducted using covariate-adjusted marginal medians, median differences,
    and probability-based effect measures that compare full marginal
    distributions.
